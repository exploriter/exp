<div class="max-w-3xl">
    <p><strong>Goodness</strong> is <em class="bg-yellow-300/40 py-0.5 px-1">what <a href="/concept/beauty/">beauty</a>
        (and therefore <em>coherence</em>) feels like from the inside</em>. It is the warm, feminine expression of
        beauty, as opposed to <a href="/concept/truth/">truth</a>, which is its cold, masculine expression.</p>
    <p>It is an embodied, participatory, relational attunement to the whole, not something inferred, calculated, or
        constructed. Goodness is known directly through resonance, presence, and care. It is what allows us to feel that
        something is right, true, and whole, even before we can explain why.</p>
    <p>Goodness is absolute. It is not contingent on preference or consensus, but stands as the moral and aesthetic
        reference point that allows us to discern whether a given truth is being used rightly. It is the absolute
        attractor that anchors vision (<a href="/concept/story/">story</a>) in love, infusing it with sacred
        orientation and ethical coherence.</p>
    <p>Goodness <em>orients to</em> beauty, beauty <em>informs</em> truth, and truth <em>serves</em> goodness.</p>
