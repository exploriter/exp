<div class="max-w-3xl">
    <p><strong>Truth</strong> is <em class="bg-yellow-300/40 py-0.5 px-1">what <a href="/concept/beauty/">beauty</a>
        (and therefore <em>coherence</em>) looks like from the outside</em>. It is the cold, masculine expression of
        beauty, as opposed to <a href="/concept/goodness/">goodness</a>, which is its warm, feminine expression.</p>
    <p>It is what appears in (and is accessible to when translated into) thought, structure, and logic. Truth lacks
        the relational embededness (<em>inside felt coherence</em>) of being attuned to the whole. It sits outside of
        coherence and reflects it, from the perspective of external observation, describing its parts and relations
        through distance, abstraction, and representation.</p>
    <p>Truth is relative, <em>unless it is guided by goodness</em>. When <em>relative truth</em> is guided by <em>absolute
        goodness</em>, it becomes <strong>capital-T Truth</strong>, that is, truth made whole through its integration
        into a greater coherence. <strong class="bg-yellow-300/40 py-0.5 px-1">The total coherence of Truth
            <em>serving</em> goodness radiates beauty</strong>, and Truth becomes not just accurate but in "right
        relationship" and alive.</p>
    <p>In isolation (without serving goodness), facts and logic can be weaponized. It is what causes <a
            href="/concept/story/">story</a> to become <em>narrative</em> rather than <em>vision</em>. Powerful, but can
        justify its manipulation and eventually seeks to dominate rather than harmonize.</p>
