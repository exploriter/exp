    <p><strong>Transjective</strong><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> is a kind of relation that is neither
        purely subjective nor purely objective, but emerges between the subject and object through their mutual
        interaction and <em>co-shaping</em>.</p>
    <p>The subjective/objective binary is insufficient for understanding things like meaning, relevance, consciousness,

        agent can readily perceive." data-tippy-placement="auto">affordances</a>, love, etc. These aren't just
        properties of the thing itself (objective), or something imagined by the human (subjective), but a <em>living
            relation between them</em>.</p>
