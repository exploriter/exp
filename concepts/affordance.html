<div class="max-w-3xl">
    <p>An <strong>affordance</strong> is what an environment (arena) offers a being (agent) and the possible actions an
        agent can readily perceive. Affordances characterize the suitability of the environment to the observer and are
        thereby relational, or <a href="/concept/transjective/"><em>transjective</em></a>, in nature. They are neither a
        property of the agent, nor the environment (arena), but a <em>real relationship between them</em>.</p>
