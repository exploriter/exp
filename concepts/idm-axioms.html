<div class="max-w-3xl">
    <p>The fundamental consideration of any domain can be (must be) resolved into exactly three concepts, each of which
        are primal and necessary to the very essence of that domain. This is known to be true for all domains.</p>
    <p>These three concepts (the modalities), which form the most basic foundation and logic of that domain, have a
        definite and describable pattern of roles that each plays with respect to the other two, and in the domain as a
        whole. The basic pattern of roles is common to the foundations of all domains. The same pattern of roles between
        these three fundamental, necessary, and intrinsic concepts will be found as the essence of all domains.</p>
    <p>The names given to the three roles (modalities) that domain primal concepts have with respect to one another are
        "the <strong>immanent</strong>", "the <strong>omniscient</strong>", and "the <strong>transcendent</strong>".</p>
    <div class="text-lg p-6 bg-purple-50 border border-purple-100 mx-6 my-12">
        <p><strong>Axiom I</strong>: The immanent is more fundamental than the omniscient and/or the transcendent. The
            omniscient and the transcendent are conjugate.</p>
        <p><strong>Axiom II</strong>: A class<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> of the transcendent will precede
            an instance<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> of the immanent. A class of the immanent will precede
            an instance of the omniscient. A class of the omniscient will precede an instance of the transcendent.</p>
        <p><strong>Axiom III</strong>: The (classes/instances) of the immanent, omniscient, and transcendent are
            distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In that the Axioms are statements of the relations between the modalities, the Axioms themselves are also
        associated (have a one-to-one correspondence) with the modalities. In this manner, the Axioms are fully
        self-describing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Axiom I</strong> has the nature of the <em>omniscient modality</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Axiom II</strong> has the nature of the <em>immanent modality</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Axiom III</strong> has the nature of the <em>transcendent modality</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Axioms are (and represent) the concept of pure form, without quality. The Modalities are (and ultimately
        represent) pure quality without form.</p>
    <p>These concepts, taken together as different representations of the same fundamental pattern, are the basis of all
        considerations of the IDM metaphysics.</p>
