<div class="max-w-3xl">
    <p><strong>Terminal Aesthetic</strong> is a modern "design" style by engineers who build interfaces that are
        characterized by functional minimalism, visual austerity, and an absence of emotional, sensory, and otherwise
        embodied intelligence. They produce systems that are logically sound but sterile, and unmistakably lacking in
        experiential refinement.</p>
    <p>The term plays on "terminal" in two senses:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Computational</strong> – evoking command-line terminals, where interaction is textual, flat, and
            unforgiving.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Existential</strong> – suggesting a kind of design that is fatal, lifeless, or hostile to organic
            experience.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Promptcore</strong>: a sub-style of the <em>terminal aesthetic</em> characterized by direct visual or
        conceptual reference to command-line interfaces, prompts, or coding environments. Often blending nostalgia for
        early computing with a raw rejection of visual comfort.</p>
