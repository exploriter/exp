    <p><strong>Rule Omega</strong><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> is a rule for generative conversations. This
        requires an upfront agreement between
        the participants to act in good faith and present with a generosity of spirit.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Everyone has something worth listening to and engaging with.</li>
        <li>Grant the benefit of the doubt.</li>
        <li>Seek first to understand before disagreeing.</li>
        <li>Ask questions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is not a call to focus on the signal at the exclusion of the noise, but to lead with the intent to
        understand the signal before criticizing the noise if necessary.</p>
