    <p class="text-lg"><strong>Databrain</strong> is a cognitive bias, a cultural pathology, and a failure of
        epistemology.</p>
    <p>It emerges when data is treated as inherently authoritative, determinative, or self-interpreting, regardless of
        what has been excluded, simplified, or misunderstood in the process. It represents truncation of human
        knowing (an overreliance on the propositional) and left-hemisphere dominant processing, resulting in flawed
        reasoning, impaired judgment, and dangerous systemic blindness.</p>
    <p>It is a form of simulated thinking; a misrecognition of processed outputs (data) as direct inputs from the
        world. It short-circuits sensemaking by replacing insight with spreadsheet artifacts, context with categories,
        and relevance with recency.</p>
    <p>It is not the <em>use</em> of data that defines databrain, it is when we collapse the world into what can be
        measured, tracked, and modeled, and then trust that model more than reality itself. It is <em
                class="bg-yellow-300/40 py-0.5 px-1">mistaking data for reality</em>.</p>
    <p>The remedy is not to reject data, but to reintegrate it within a fuller ecology of knowing, rooted in embodied
        skill, shared perspective, and attuned participation.</p>
