<div class="max-w-3xl">
    <p>Beauty is the perception of <em>coherence</em>. Where <em>inner and outer</em>, <em>truth and goodness</em>, <em>mind
        and world</em>, are aligned and in <em>right relationship</em>.</p>
    <p>It is the most fundamental of the Goodness, Truth, and Beauty triad (transcendentals). Truth is its masculine,
        cold, outer expression, while Goodness is its feminine, warm, inner expression. Where <em>truth serves
            goodness</em>, there is beauty.</p>

    <p>It is the guide by which <em>Story</em> knows itself to be living, and the criterion by which we distinguish
        between the two fundamental expressions of story: <em>vision</em> and <em>narrative</em>.</p>
    <p>It is the attractor around which culture coheres and the evidence of the alignment and <em>right
        relationship</em> between <em>power</em> and <em>wisdom</em>.</p>
