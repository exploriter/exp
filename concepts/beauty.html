    <p><em class="bg-yellow-300/40 py-0.5 px-1">Beauty is the perception of coherence</em>. Where <em>inner and
        outer</em>, <em><a href="/concept/truth/">truth</a>
        and <a href="/concept/goodness/">goodness</a></em>, <em>mind and world</em>, are aligned and in <em>right
        relationship</em>.</p>
    <p>It is the most fundamental of the Goodness, Truth, and Beauty triad (<a href="/story/transcendentals/">transcendentals</a>).
        Truth is its masculine, cold, outer expression, while goodness is its feminine, warm, inner expression. Beauty
        <em>informs</em> truth, truth <em>serves</em> goodness, and goodness <em>orients to</em> beauty.</p>

    <p>It is the guide by which <a href="/concept/story/"><em>story</em></a> knows itself to be living, and the
        criterion by which we distinguish between the two fundamental expressions of story: <em>vision</em> and <em>narrative</em>.
    </p>
    <p>It is the attractor around which culture coheres and the evidence of the alignment and <em>right
        relationship</em> between <em>power</em> and <em>wisdom</em>.</p>
