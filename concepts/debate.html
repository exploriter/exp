    <p><a href="/concept/conversation-types/">Debate</a> is a 2-way, competitive (win-lose), argumentative engagement
        focused on finding flaws with the goal of persuasion and rhetorical victory.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Present</strong> arguments (to build a case).</li>
        <li><strong>Attack</strong> arguments (to tear down the other side’s case).</li>
        <li><strong>Defend</strong> and repair arguments (from attack).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Because debate happens linearly, these three things quickly become difficult to follow for both the participants
        and the audience. The debate tends toward being asymmetric (someone always gets the first and last word),
        incomplete, chaotic, disorganized, disengaged, inefficient, equivocal, ambiguous, and prone to gamesmanship (ad
        hominem, strawman, dodging, etc.).</p>
    <p>However, unlike dialogue, debate lends itself to a stricter structure so we can use tools and technology to move
        from a state of chaos (obscurity) to order (clarity).</p>
    <p>For example<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, live visual aids of the debate tree structure so everyone
        can follow along as arguments get sorted
        into agreements and disagreements, which makes it challenging to obscure anything (and obvious when it
        occurs).</p>
