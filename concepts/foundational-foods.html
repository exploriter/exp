    <p class="text-lg/7.5">A <em>purpose-driven model of an ideal human diet</em>, ordered by biological intent rather
        than industrial priorities or scientifically reductive recommendations. Foods are organized into tiers based on
        their
        role in sustaining life and vitality.</p>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mt-12">Tier 1 Foods</h2>
    <p class="italic">Direct provisioning for offspring. Meant specifically to nurture a new life from zero to
        complete.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mammalian Milk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Honey/Royal Jelly (fast energy)</li>
        <li>Seeds/Nuts (slow energy)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mt-12">Tier 2 Foods</h2>
    <p class="italic">Nutrient-dense whole animals to sustain the organism through stages of life after provisioning
        (the finished product of Tier 1).</p>

    <p class="italic">Sugar-rich and fat-rich foods that are made specifically to attract animals for
        dispersal/pollination.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fruit</li>
        <li>Nectar</li>
        <li>Sap</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mt-12">Tier 4 Foods</h2>
    <p class="italic">Supporting structural/functional plant parts that are used as defenses, photosynthetic machinery,
        or storage organs.</p>

        <li>Stems</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="italic">Tier 4 foods are consumed for variety/diversity and used temporarily or instrumentally in the
        following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Supplements</strong>: to replenish what is missing.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptogens</strong>: to balance what is stressed.</li>
        <li><strong>Therapeutics</strong>: to heal what is broken.</li>
        <li><strong>Nootropics</strong>: to enhance and provide clarity to the mind.</li>
        <li><strong>Psychotropics</strong>: to transform and integrate toward awakening.</li>
    </ul>
