<div class="max-w-3xl">
    <p><strong>Story</strong> is the <em class="bg-yellow-300/40 py-0.5 px-1">living mediator of the relationship
        between potentiality and actuality</em>. It is the means by which we explore, illustrate, and communicate
        complex ideas, values, and ultimately create the future. As the carrier of meaning and coherence, <em
                class="bg-yellow-300/40 py-0.5 px-1">story shapes how reality unfolds</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When perceived and enacted through <strong>love</strong>, it becomes <em>vision</em> — a sacred guide toward
            goodness and truth through <a href="/concept/beauty/">beauty</a>.
        </li>
        <li>When manipulated through <strong>fear</strong>, it becomes <em>narrative</em> — a reductive control
            structure that masquerades as meaning.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>While many stories arise in mundane or seemingly neutral forms, not obviously led by love or fear, to the degree
        they guide perception and action (ultimately choice), they lean toward one or the other of these two archetypal
        poles.</p>
