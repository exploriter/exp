        <p><strong>Best practices</strong> are not about maximizing greatness, they are about minimizing failure, for
            the
            largest number
            of people, across the widest range of situations.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>They are a form of <em>institutionalized safetyism</em>, disguised as excellence.</li>
            <li>They are <em>mediocrity</em>, sold as wisdom.</li>
            <li>They <em>optimize for not being blamed</em>, not for being outstanding.</li>
            <li>They are <em>mimetically best</em>, not ontologically best.</li>
            <li>They are <em>fit for the average</em>, not for the exceptional.</li>
            <li>They <em>succeed through survivability</em>, not through superiority.</li>
            <li>They are <em>good for creating minimum viable competence</em>, not maximum creative mastery.</li>
            <li>They <em>represent past optimizations</em>, not future innovations.</li>
            <li>They <em>favor conformity</em> over insight.</li>
            <li>They <em>reward obedience</em> over creativity.</li>
            <li>They <em>compress complexity</em> into simple heuristics, sacrificing adaptability.</li>
