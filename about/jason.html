    <p>I was alive before there was a digital <em>inter-network</em>, before the world was a <em>wide web</em> of
        00110001 00100111 01110011 00100000 01100001 01101110 01100100 00100000 00110000 00100111 01110011.</p>
    <p>Gratefully, there is no cold record of my life in those times, only the warm memories of ordinary mortal
        minds. Since then, I have surrendered somewhat to the inevitable cybernetic future, and as such, you have
        landed on the site of my <em>personal web</em>.</p>
    <p>I do my best work when exploring complex ideas, clarifying complicated systems, and/or getting my hands
        dirty. Preferably, in conscious face-to-face collaboration with others who are committed to
        <em>truth</em>, <em>goodness</em>, and <em>beauty</em>.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I have explored many domains as a software engineer, web designer, product strategist,
        information architect, author, fitness trainer, line cook, theater projectionist, rare coin and diamond
        merchant, trading card dealer, amateur horticulturist, paraphernalia glassblower, amateur corporate cutpurse
        (reformed), and postal worker.</p>
    <p><b>In 2009</b>, I created a recipe blog to learn SEO. Its success landed me a multi-book<sup><a
            href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> deal that has since produced a national bestseller, seven
        translations, and sold over 300,000 copies.
    </p>
    <p><b>From 2010 to 2015</b>, I designed and developed over 100 websites for small to medium-sized businesses,
        non-profits, and universities, under the brand, <i>Designpx</i>.</p>
    <p><b>From 2014 to 2020</b>, I was part of the core leadership team (CTO) at GMB Fitness. Leading product
        development
        and improving team cohesion systems and practices across the company.</p>
    <p><b>From 2020 to 2023</b>, I took a work hiatus to pursue unencumbered thinking, reading, and other
        philosophical,
        spiritual, and embodied practices, ending in my volunteering at
        <a href="https://vervaekefoundation.org" target="_blank">The Vervaeke Foundation</a> to help launch their
        series of websites.</p>
    <p><b>Since 2024</b>, I have been building <span class="font-averia lowercase text-lg">Exploriter</span> in
        earnest. A symbolic portmanteau (explore/exploit tradeoff) for a creative endeavor comprising loosely
        related ideas, interests, and collaborations. Some of which have long lingered in my mind and heart, and
        since they refuse to leave, I must pursue them.</p>
    <p>I am most interested in the (psycho)technologies that are integral to developing, disseminating, and teaching
        various practices that fundamentally tackle diverse personal, relational, and societal issues (such as
        crises in meaning, belonging, reality, globalization, addiction, information, education, and so on). The
        kinds of things that guide and help maintain the <em>right relationship</em> between the physical, the
        virtual, and the spiritual. And acknowledge and focus on the deeper <em>metacrisis</em> at the heart of the
        <em>polycrisis</em>.</p>
    <p>I am seeking projects that promote the cultivation of wisdom, are inherently imbued with meaning, and allow
        minds and bodies to effectively and playfully convene to live more fully and create more virtuously.</p>
    <p>I thrive in the communal and active part of the ideation process: the work that brings clarity to an idea, as
        well as the expansion, enhancement, and attention to detail necessary once something is active in the real
        world.</p>
    <p>I am quite indifferent to strictly hierarchical, position-based organizational structures and prefer a more
        horizontal, variable role-based approach for most endeavors, especially where technology and shifting
        contexts are concerned.</p>
    <p>Ideally, the team I work with is on the smaller side and has a deep understanding, or at least awareness, of
        how group organizational archetypes (consensus, meritocracy, democracy) work together as a counterbalancing
        decision-making process for coherent and sustainable small group dynamics.</p>
    <p>In general, I am looking to do meaningful work that affords wholesomeness and evokes the pioneering spirit of
        adventure.</p>
    <p>Offline, I maintain a diverse movement practice that includes (but is never limited to) kettlebell training,
        rope flow, stability ball, elements of qigong, bodyweight floor movements, heavybag, sprinting, breathwork,
        and all the fresh air, sunshine, and grounding I can get.</p>
