    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold"><span class="bg-blue-300/40 py-0.5 px-1 font-bold">Loop 1:</span> Beauty, Truth,
        and Goodness</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beauty</strong> ↔ <em>Immanent</em></li>
        <li><strong>Truth</strong> ↔ <em>Omniscient</em></li>
        <li><strong>Goodness</strong> ↔ <em>Transcendent</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>We'll start with <em>beauty</em> since it is the most fundamental (immanent) and loop back to it. Here is what
        the full loop looks like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="opacity-40">...Goodness →</span> <span
                class="font-bold"><span class="bg-yellow-300/40 py-0.5 px-1">Beauty</span> → Truth → Goodness</span>
            <span class="opacity-40">→ Beauty...</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>And here is the same loop but adding in classes and instances:</p>
</div>
<div class="max-w-5xl">
    <ul>
        <li><span class="opacity-40">...Goodness<sup>c</sup> →</span> <span class="font-bold"><span
                class="bg-yellow-300/40 py-0.5 px-1">Beauty<sup>i</sup> ⇒ Beauty<sup>c</sup></span> → Truth<sup>i</sup> ⇒ Truth<sup>c</sup> → Goodness<sup>i</sup> ⇒ Goodness<sup>c</sup></span>
            <span class="opacity-40">→ Beauty<sup>i</sup>...</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="max-w-3xl">
    <p>And here is the same loop again but now fully abstracted using our notation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="opacity-40">...T<sup>c</sup> →</span> <span class="font-bold"><span
                class="bg-yellow-300/40 py-0.5 px-1">I<sup>i</sup> ⇒ I<sup>c</sup></span> → O<sup>i</sup> ⇒ O<sup>c</sup> → T<sup>i</sup> ⇒ T<sup>c</sup></span>
            <span class="opacity-40">→ I<sup>i</sup>...</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In English, this is just saying:</p>
    <p><em>...a class of goodness precedes an instance of beauty (which implies a
        class of beauty), which precedes an instance of truth (which implies a class of truth), which precedes an
        instance of goodness (which implies a class of goodness), which precedes and instance of beauty...</em></p>
    <p>Or, more verbose, but less abstract:</p>
    <p><em>...the general concept of goodness always comes before a specific beautiful thing (which brings along with it
        the general concept of beauty), which always comes before a specific true thing (which brings along with it the
        general concept of truth), which always comes before a specific good thing (which brings along with it the
        general concept of goodness), which always comes before a specific beautiful thing...</em></p>
    <p>Now let's actually proceed through the loop:</p>
    <h4 class="font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Step 0: Beauty as Immanent (I<sup>i</sup>)</h4>
    <p>Since <a href="/concept/beauty/">beauty is the perception of coherence</a>, we start with its immediate encounter
        and disclosure. It is not yet explained. A moment, a face, an act, a landscape, a painting, a
        sentence...whatever it is, it just lands with <em>rightness</em>.</p>
    <p>But wait! We know that this instance of beauty (immanent) must be preceded by a class of goodness
        (transcendent) as we might already be wondering, <em>what makes this encounter recognizable as beauty at
            all?</em></p>
    <h4 class="font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Step 1a: From Goodness to Beauty (T<sup>c</sup> → I<sup>i</sup>)</h4>
    <p>Since <a href="/concept/goodness/">goodness is what beauty (and therefore coherence) feels like from the
        inside</a>, we can now properly start the loop with beauty since we now know how we were able to recognize it as
        such in the first place. Goodness, as the transcendent horizon of the possibility/recognizability of <em>rightness</em>,
        is why this particular instance of coherence shows up as beautiful.</p>
    <h4 class="font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Step 1b: The Immanent Class that Beauty Implies (I<sup>i</sup> ⇒ I<sup>c</sup>)</h4>
    <p>Encountering a specific instance of beauty implies there is a generalizable <em>kind</em> of thing here. The
        <em>general recognizability of wholeness in perception</em>. In other words, beauty as a class.</p>
    <h4 class="font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Step 2a: From Beauty to Truth (I<sup>c</sup> → O<sup>i</sup>)</h4>
    <p>Since <a href="/concept/truth/">truth is what beauty (and therefore coherence) looks like from the outside</a>,
        we can begin to articulate coherence to capture some aspect of it. Maybe we percieve a painting as harmonious
        (instance of beauty), which implies harmony as a class, and then we can produce propositions like, "...it is
        harmonious because the proportions of such and such are balanced...," etc.</p>
    <p>Notice that this truth is always selective and partial. Focussing on parts makes it immensely powerful, but that
        power is ultimately destructive if it loses connection to wholeness. And its only connection to the whole is
        when it is in service to goodness.</p>
    <h4 class="font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Step 2b: The Omniscient Class that Truth Implies (O<sup>i</sup> ⇒ O<sup>c</sup>)
    </h4>
    <p>Encountering a specific instance of truth, again implies there is a generalizable <em>kind</em> of thing here.
        Intelligibility-as-such. "Truth in principle," form, logic, lawfulness, the propositional space. In other words,
        truth as a class.</p>
    <h4 class="font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Step 3a: From Truth to Goodness (O<sup>c</sup> → T<sup>i</sup>)</h4>
    <p>What "ought" to be arises when a particular situation becomes intelligible in a way that discloses choice. It is
        the space where reason becomes real and there is a concrete call to do (or not do). You cannot be obligated by
        that which you literally cannot make sense of in some way.</p>
    <h4 class="font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Step 3b: The Transcendent Class that Goodness Implies (T<sup>i</sup> ⇒ T<sup>c</sup>)
    </h4>
    <p>Encountering a specific instance of goodness, once again implies there is a generalizable <em>kind</em> of thing
        here. The transcendent horizon of the possibility/recognizability of <em>rightness</em>, obligation, worthiness.
        In other words, goodness as a class.</p>
    <h4 class="font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Step 4/1a: From Goodness Back to Beauty (T<sup>c</sup> → I<sup>i</sup>)</h4>
    <p>The horizon of worthiness now tunes our attention, shapes what is salient, and trains our perceptions so that the
        immanent world shows up as a field of coherence that we can participate in and with. Beauty is perceived as
        beauty, and the loop continues into eternity.</p>
    <p>And so, going back to the beginning, we can say:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Goodness</strong> <em>orients to</em> <strong>Beauty</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Beauty</strong> <em>informs</em> <strong>Truth</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Truth</strong> <em>serves</em> <strong>Goodness</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
