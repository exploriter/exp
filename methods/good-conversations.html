    <img src="/img/conversations.png" alt="Conversation Types" class="hidden lg:block lg:float-right w-100 mb-2 ml-2">
    <ul>
        <li>Be mindful of the <a href="/concept/conversation-types/" data-tippy-placement="auto"
                                 data-tooltip="Dialogue, discourse, debate, and diatribe.">type of conversation</a>
            throughout (even as it shifts around).
        </li>
        <li>The connection matters far more than the content that flows through it.</li>
        <li>Each communication is an opportunity to strengthen and develop the bandwidth and integrity of the
            connection.
        </li>
        <li>If there is no mutual respect, it probably doesn't make sense to engage.</li>
        <li>Virtues and values to keep in mind: kindness, generosity, sincerity, earnestness, care, honesty, integrity,
            humility, curiosity, friendliness, open-mindedness, rigor, compassion, forgiveness, loyalty, impeccability,
            thoughtfulness, consideration, and above all, love.

    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mt-6 inline-block border-b border-b-stone-400">Listening in Conversations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Employ <a href="/concept/rule-omega/" data-tippy-placement="auto"
                      data-tooltip="A rule for generative conversations. Everyone has something worth listening to and engaging with.">Rule
            Omega</a> (and disengage with those who seek to weaponize this concept).
        </li>
        <li>Assume everyone is trying to express something meaningful and listen to isolate the signal from the noise.
        </li>
        <li>If it's worth engaging, it must be worth listening through possible grievance-induced exaggerations and
            distortions to find meaningful truths.
        </li>
        <li>Listen to steelman the other persons position.
        </li>
        <li>Tacit knowledge (lived experience) can be hard to articulate. Listening well and asking questions can help
            elucidate it.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mt-6 inline-block border-b border-b-stone-400">Speaking in Conversations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Speaking</em> is not the same as <em>communicating</em>. If the message you intend is not received, you
            are speaking without communicating. Take responsibility to communicate effectively.
        </li>
        <li>Use language that engenders openness rather than defensiveness.</li>
        <li>Do not use absolutes (always, never, the reality is…) as they come across as power plays.</li>
        <li>Do not entangle important points with subtle criticisms such that it is impossible for the other person to
            accept the point without losing face.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid attitudes of righteousness, superiority, dismissiveness, overconfidence, and indifference.</li>
        <li>Beware emotive (Russell's) conjugation.</li>
        <li>Slow down (especially when things get hot). Take the time to formulate your speech with clarity and
            precision.
        </li>
        <li>Admit ignorance of words and concepts you do not understand and ask for clarification.</li>
        <li>Give credit rather than seek it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mt-6 inline-block border-b border-b-stone-400">Conversational Traps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Throwing aside your intentions when things get hot.</li>
        <li>Ad hominem attacks.</li>
        <li>Strawmanning.</li>
        <li>Mistaking and rationalizing poor behavior for passion.</li>
        <li>Justifying poor behavior because the other person's views are "bad" (and they deserve it).</li>
        <li>Using humor to insult the other with plausible deniability.</li>
        <li>Thinking about what you're going to say when the other person is talking.</li>
    </ul>
