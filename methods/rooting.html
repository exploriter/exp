    <p><strong>Rootedness</strong> is about finding the right kind of relaxation in meditation. An interpenetration of
        sensitization and stabilization so you can optimally flow in any situation — especially dialogically. It's about
        finding the <em>optimal grip between yin and yang</em>.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Imagine something like a balloon in the space above your head.</li>
        <li>Inhale and imagine the balloon expanding in all directions. <em>Yang</em>.</li>
        <li>Exhale and it gathers back. <em>Yin</em>.</li>
        <li>Do this until you find the spot for you that is in-between.</li>
        <li>Allow it to drain or melt into your forehead. <em>Third eye</em>.</li>
        <li class="font-semibold border border-dashed border-stone-300 px-4 py-2 my-2">Repeat for the throat, then the
            heart, solar plexus, belly, your seat, and finally let it sink into the earth below you.
        </li>
        <li>Imagine it like the roots of a tree, connecting and stabilizing you downward, but also nourishing,
            energizing, and sensitizing you upward so you are sitting, rooted, <em>as still as a mountain but alert as
                a warrior</em>.
        </li>
    </ol>
