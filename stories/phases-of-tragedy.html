    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">Pre-tragic</h2>
    <p class="italic">Naive optimism (belief).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hasn't encountered the depth and complexity of the problem space (or isn't even aware of the larger problem
            space with which this optimism is embedded).
        </li>
        <li>The <em>life will find a way</em> narrative: "There have always been problems and humanity has, and will
            continue to, rise to the challenge."
        </li>
        <li>The <em>better angels</em> narrative (<em>Pinker</em>, <em>Rosling</em>, <em>Gates</em>, etc.): "Things are,
            on the whole, getting better."
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mt-12">Tragic</h2>
    <p class="italic">Cynicism and nihilism.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Once you begin to explore the depth and complexity of the problem space, the solutions appear to be
            impossible. Any one solution seems to make other problems worse (or just shifts the problem elsewhere).
        </li>
        <li>Can lead to an even deeper realization that many of the complicated systems we rely on for managing the
            complex systems we care about most are self-terminating.
        </li>
        <li>Leads to <strong>cynicism</strong>: doubt in the human capacity to make effective, moral, and ethical
            decisions, and eventually, <strong>nihilism</strong>: the feeling that there is nothing humanity can do and
            there is no inherent goodness, badness, or meaning in anything anyway.
        </li>
        <li>Although this cynicism and nihilism is a wiser stance than naive optimism, it is like moving from slavery to
            the "freedom" of wandering in the desert.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mt-12">Post-tragic</h2>
    <p class="italic">Mature optimism (faith).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Realization that there is a false certainty in both the pre-tragic view (naive optimism) and the tragic view
            (cynicism/nihilism).
        </li>
        <li>An appreciation of, and faith in, the <a href="/concept/known-unknown/">unknown-unknowns</a> (where possible
            solutions reside).
        </li>
        <li>Where naive optimism says, "We already know it'll be fine, trust me!", mature optimism says, "We don't know
            exactly how things might get better, but we stay open and engaged because real possibilities often lie
            beyond what we currently see."
        </li>
        <li>It's a different kind of "optimism" precisely because it isn't rooted in denial or unexamined assumptions,
            but in a willingness to keep exploring, collaborating, and learning in the face of daunting complexity.
        </li>
    </ul>
