    <p class="text-lg"><strong>WTF happened in 1971?</strong> Whatever happened, it's widely recognized as an inflection
        point in modern economic history and believed to have had far-reaching effects in social, economic, political,
        cultural, and technological spheres worldwide.</p>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mt-12 mb-6 inline-block border-b border-b-stone-400">The Bretton Woods Agreement</h2>
    <p>The Bretton Woods Agreement was established in July 1944, during World War II, by delegates from 44 Allied
        nations in a meeting in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. They gathered to design a new international monetary
        system aimed at promoting global economic stability which included:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Pegged Exchange Rates</strong> (<em>currency</em> → <em>dollar</em> → <em>gold</em>)
            <ul>
                <li>Each member country pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar, and the U.S. dollar was in turn pegged
                    to gold at a fixed rate of $35 per troy ounce.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>U.S. Dollar as the World's Reserve Currency</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Because the dollar was effectively "as good as gold," it became the world's primary reserve
                    currency.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>To oversee and ensure the stability of this new international monetary system through surveillance,
                    lending, and technical assistance.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Creation of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Initially focused on financing the rebuilding of war-torn Europe, over time, it evolved into the
                    <em>World Bank Group</em>.

    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-6 inline-block border-b border-b-stone-400">Gold Standard → Fiat</h2>
    <p>In August 1971, President Richard Nixon "closed the gold window," suspending the direct convertibility of dollars
        to gold—often referred to as the "Nixon Shock"—which effectively ended the Bretton Woods system, beginning an
        era of free-floating fiat currencies worldwide, where money was no longer backed by a physical commodity (gold)
        but rather by government decree alone.</p>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mt-12 mb-6 inline-block border-b border-b-stone-400">The Effects of Fiat Currency?</h2>
    <p>Severing the link between the dollar and gold removed a key anchor on monetary and fiscal policy, effecting
        everything from technological progress, stability, growth, government overreach, wealth distribution, and many
        other socio-economic metrics. Often referred to as the beginning of "The Great Stagnation."</p>

            <strong>Rise of Rent-Seeking</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Before 1971</em>, the economy was largely based on productive industries: manufacturing,
                    agriculture, and physical infrastructure. Companies made money by producing real goods and services.
                </li>
                <li><em>After 1971</em>, as fiat currency, financialization, and deregulation expanded, businesses
                    increasingly focused on extracting economic rents instead of creating tangible value.
                </li>
                <li>

                            <strong>Financialization of the Economy</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The ability to expand credit and inflate assets led to the rise of finance,
                                    insurance, and real estate (FIRE) industries.
                                </li>
                                <li>Instead of investing in manufacturing, productive infrastructure, or innovation,
                                    corporations funneled money into stock buybacks, mergers, and speculative trading.
                                </li>
                                <li>Financial institutions moved away from productive lending (investing in small
                                    businesses and infrastructure) toward predatory lending, subprime mortgages, and
                                    consumer debt traps.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rise of Monopolies</strong>: Post-1970s, anti-monopoly enforcement weakened,
                            allowing corporations to consolidate industries: <em>Big Tech</em>, <em>Big Pharma</em>,
                            <em>Big Ag</em>, <em>Big Oil</em>, media conglomerates, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Regulatory Capture</strong>: Large corporations heavily lobbied governments to
                            secure tax breaks, regulatory advantages, and subsidies.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Intellectual Property and Patent Trolling</strong>: Companies began accumulating
                            patents not to innovate but to sue competitors and block new entrants.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Healthcare Grift</strong>: Instead of providing cost-efficient care, the U.S.
                            healthcare system became a financialized, debt-driven system.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Higher Education Grift</strong>: Universities raised tuition far beyond inflation,
                            exploiting student loans backed by the government.
                        </li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Decoupling of Real Wages and Productivity Gains</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Before 1971</em>, wages and productivity grew together. As workers produced more goods and
                    services, their incomes increased at a similar rate, allowing for rising living standards.
                </li>
                <li><em>After 1971</em>, productivity continued to rise, but wages began to stagnate. The wealth
                    generated from increased productivity was increasingly captured by corporations, capital owners, and
                    executives rather than distributed to workers.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Embedded Growth Obligations</strong>: Institutions were built on assumptions of continuous economic
            growth. Once growth slowed and real wages stopped rising in tandem with productivity, those obligations
            became increasingly unsustainable, causing institutions to construct false realities to maintain the status
            quo.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Technological Progress</strong>: Exhausting the "low-hanging fruit" of big technological
            breakthroughs along with the financialization of the incentive structure, caused tech progress to stagnate
            (aside from the digital).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rising Wealth and Income Inequality</strong>: Unrestrained fiat money and credit expansion inflate
            asset prices (stocks, real estate) faster than wages, favoring those who already hold capital.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Erosion of the Middle Class</strong>: As wage growth stalled while the cost of housing, education,
            and healthcare accelerated, the "American Dream"—where each generation is better off—became harder to
            reach.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Inflation and Currency Devaluation</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Governments and central banks have an incentive to expand the money supply for short-term economic
                    and political gains, reducing long-term purchasing power.
                </li>
                <li>Inflation (effectively legalized counterfeiting) floods the market with currency, thereby reducing
                    the worth of your dollars purchasing power—taking your money without your consent.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Emergence of the Petrodollar System</strong>: After gold convertibility ended, the U.S. struck deals
            (notably with Saudi Arabia) to price oil on the global market in dollars, thereby maintaining the dollar's
            global dominance and reserve currency status.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Increased Boom-Bust Cycles</strong>: With fewer constraints on credit expansion, speculative bubbles
            can inflate rapidly. When they pop, systemic crises ensue.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Growth of Government Debt and Deficits</strong>: Without the hard constraint of gold, policymakers
            can more easily borrow and spend.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Emergence of "Sound Money" Alternatives</strong>: Returning to a gold-like (but improved) standard
            by adopting alternatives such as Bitcoin can prevent unchecked money creation, thus (theoretically) avoiding
            many of the post-1971 problems.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Social Unrest and Political Polarization</strong>: Rising economic anxieties can be linked to
            populist movements, skepticism toward central banks and government policy, distrust in institutions, and
            various other culture wars.
        </li>
