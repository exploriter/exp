    <h2 class="text-xl mt-12 mb-6"><strong data-term="i">Beauty</strong> <em>informs</em> <strong
            data-term="o">Truth</strong> (I<sup>i</sup> ⇒ I<sup>c</sup> → O<sup>i</sup> ⇒ O<sup>c</sup>)</h2>
    <p>Since <a href="/concept/beauty/">beauty is the perception of coherence</a>, we start with its immediate encounter
        and disclosure. It is not yet explained. A moment, a face, an act, a landscape, a painting, a
        sentence...whatever it is, it just lands with <em>rightness</em>.</p>
    <p>But wait! According to Axiom II, we know that this particular immanent instance of beauty must be preceded by a
        transcendent class of goodness. And we're probably already asking, <em>what makes this encounter recognizable as
            beauty at all?</em></p>
    <p>Since <a href="/concept/goodness/">goodness is what beauty (and therefore coherence) feels like from the
        inside</a>, we can now properly start the loop with beauty since we now know how we were able to recognize it as
        such in the first place. Goodness, as the transcendent horizon of the possibility/recognizability of <em>rightness</em>,
        is why this particular instance of coherence shows up as beautiful.</p>
    <p>And encountering a specific instance of beauty implies there is a generalizable <em>kind</em> of thing here. The
        <em>general recognizability of wholeness in perception</em>. In other words, beauty as a class.</p>
    <p>Since <a href="/concept/truth/">truth is what beauty (and therefore coherence) looks like from the outside</a>,
        we can begin to articulate coherence to capture some aspect of it. Maybe we percieve a painting as harmonious
        (instance of beauty), which implies harmony as a class, and then we can produce propositions like, "...it is
        harmonious because the proportions of such and such are balanced...," etc.</p>
    <h2 class="text-xl mt-12 mb-6"><strong data-term="o">Truth</strong> <em>serves</em> <strong
            data-term="t">Goodness</strong> (O<sup>i</sup> ⇒ O<sup>c</sup> → T<sup>i</sup> ⇒ T<sup>c</sup>)</h2>
    <p>Notice that this truth is always selective and partial. Focussing on parts makes it immensely powerful, but that
        power is ultimately destructive if it loses connection to wholeness. And its only connection to wholeness is
        when it is in service to goodness.</p>
    <p>We notice again that a specific instance of truth implies there is a generalizable truth.
        Intelligibility-as-such. "Truth in principle," form, logic, lawfulness, the propositional space. In other words,
        truth as a class.</p>
    <h2 class="text-xl mt-12 mb-6"><strong data-term="t">Goodness</strong> <em>orients to</em> <strong data-term="i">Beauty</strong>
        (T<sup>i</sup> ⇒ T<sup>c</sup> → I<sup>i</sup> ⇒ I<sup>c</sup>)</h2>
    <p>What "ought to be" arises when a particular situation becomes intelligible in a way that discloses choice. It is
        the space where reason becomes real and there is a concrete call to do (or not do). You cannot be obligated by
        that which you literally cannot make sense of in some way.</p>
    <p>And, of course, encountering a specific instance of goodness means there is a generalizable goodness. The
        transcendent horizon of the possibility/recognizability of <em>rightness</em>, obligation, worthiness. In other
        words, goodness as a class.</p>
    <p>The horizon of worthiness now tunes our attention, shapes what is salient, and trains our perceptions so that the
        immanent world shows up as a field of coherence that we can participate in and with. Beauty is perceived as
        beauty, and the loop continues into eternity.</p>
